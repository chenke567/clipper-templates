## About

To extract content from **GitHub Releases** using [Obsidian-web-Clipper](../Resources/Obsidian-web-Clipper.md), we can use [selector variables](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper?tab=readme-ov-file#selector-variables), to extract only the **release information** content.

## TLDR

Selectors we use in this (example) template

```text
{{selectorHtml:.markdown-body|markdown}}
```

## Example details

Let's use the release notes for Obsidian Web Clipper 0.9.3 as an example.
Source page: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/releases/tag/0.9.3

Rendering the page directly in the browser, usually results in something like:

In this example, we want to extract only the text from the 0.9.3 release notes, meaning content from both headings "New" and "Improved".

### Inspecting the web page for elements to target

To find the respective elements to extract (using selector variables), we can use the [developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open) in the browser, then search for the relevant content, usually by pressing e.g. `Cmd + Option + I` (macOS), or `F12`. Another quick way to inspect the elements, is simply right clicking click the elements we want to use (selector or selectorHtml)

Notice that if we "hover" the "New" part in the developer tools, the browser dynamically highlights the parts we select in the developer tools.

If we then hover over the `div` (one level up from `<h2>New<h2>`), we can see that this is the part we actually want to clip. In this case, it seems that the class selector `.markdown-body` can be used to extract the content we need (again, see [[Resources/Learning-about-CSS-selectors]] for a more deepdive on the different class selectors)

### Testing

Let's test...

In our clipper template, we include the selector we identified above, like this

```text
{{selectorHtml:.markdown-body|markdown}}
```

In short:

- `selectorHtml` to specify what element from the page we to extract
- `.markdown-body` to use the class we identified above
- `|markdown` to convert the HTML data (as we use `selectorHtml`) into Markdown

> [!NOTE]
> Note that we here use `selectorHtml`, as it sometimes result in better content clipping, especially for code blocks, and special formatting

Trying to use the clipper with the new template, it should result in something like below:
